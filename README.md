# School Management System
A java-GUI project implementing a school management system. This application features secured role-based login for teachers and admins. Depending on the selected user type, the system directs users to either an admin panel or a teacher module. The admin panel includes functionality for creating accounts, registering students, managing exam routines, and handling class and subject management. The system also includes a logging feature that allows administrators to view recent user login activity, ensuring secure access to school data.
